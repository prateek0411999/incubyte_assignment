**Description:**

This project contains a string converter written in Ruby. The string_convertor.rb file contains the implementation of the string convert method, and the string_convertor_spec.rb file contains the corresponding RSpec tests for TDD (Test-Driven Development) purposes. The project utilizes Ruby version 2.6.10, RSpec for testing, and Byebug for debugging.

**Setup Instructions**

1. Install **Ruby 2.6.10**: If you don't have Ruby 2.6.10 installed on your system, you can download it from the official Ruby website: Ruby Installer.
2. Install **RSpec**: This project uses RSpec for testing. If you haven't installed RSpec yet, you can install it via RubyGems by running:  gem install rspec.
3. Install **Byebug**: (Optional) If you need to debug the code, you can insert 'byebug' statements in the code where you want to pause execution and inspect variables.
4. **Clone the Repository**
5. **Run the Tests**: Execute the RSpec tests to ensure everything is working correctly: rspec string_convertor_spec.rb


**Note:**
Method and ClassName used are different then what was mentioned on the assessment, Used **Convert** as method name instead of **Add**, StringConvertor as StringCalculator
